# Front-End Projects

Welcome,

This is a collection of my front-end projects. The developer is me, alone, in a small room with my computer.

Here is the list of projects, some of them are in this repository, some are on CodePen.io. 
This happens because seeing them on CodePen is easier to see, and sometimes I have to deal with compatibility issues.

## Projects
Most of these projects are developed with html, css and JavaScript. If there is anything else,  such as API, I will put them as additional information
